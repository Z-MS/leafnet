Difference between vectors and scalars. Created by Sal Khan.\n\nWatch the next lesson: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/v/calculating-average-velocity-or-speed?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=physics\n\nMissed the previous lesson? https://www.khanacademy.o,rg/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/v/introduction-to-physics?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=physics\n\nPhysics on Khan Academy: Physics is the study of the basic principles that govern the physical world around us. We'll start by looking at motion itself. Then, we'll learn about forces, momentum, energy, and other concepts in lots of different physical situations. To get the most out of physics, you'll need a solid understanding of algebra and a basic understanding of trigonometry.\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. We believe learners of all ages should have unlimited access to free educational content they can master at their own pace. We use intelligent software, deep data analytics and intuitive user interfaces to help students and teachers around the world. Our resources cover preschool through early college education, including math, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, finance, history, grammar and more. We offer free personalized SAT test prep in partnership with the test developer, the College Board. Khan Academy has been translated into dozens of languages, and 100 million people use our platform worldwide every year.
